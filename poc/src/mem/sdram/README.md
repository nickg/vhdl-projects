# Namespace `PoC.mem.sdram`

The namespace `PoC.mem.sdram` offers components for the access of external SDRAMs.
A common finite state-machine is used to address the memory via banks, rows and
columns. Different physical layers are provide for the single-data-rate (SDR) or
double-data-rate (DDR, DDR2, ...) data bus. One has to instantiate the specific
module required by the FPGA board.
