About ZPU licensing:

The license for HDL implementations is FreeBSD to be
friendly towards commercial projects and other open source
projects, however the architecture, documentation and tools will be GPL.

This means that all updates to the architecture must be shared, but actual
implementations(which are small and can be very project speific) can
be friendly towards commercial considerations.

Patches to update files w/correct licensing info will be most appreciated!

The ZPU and all the files are per 1/1-2008 Copyright Zylin AS, i.e.
Zylin is free to decide upon the BSD license for HDL implementation
and GPL for architecture, tools and documentation.
